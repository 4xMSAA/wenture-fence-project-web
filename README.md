This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## Unity Build Files

Place the Build folder in `public/unity` or change the location where you want to have them in `src/app/page.js`.


## Remarks

Heed my warning: this does not use React in a sane way. This is my first React project ever.
